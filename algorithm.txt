Computer algorithm:
1. Easy
Chooses random free cell
2. Medium
Chooses third cell if 2 cells in a row/column/diagonal taken or
else random cell
3. Hard
Chooses center cell first if "X",
chooses third cell if 2 cells in a row/column/diagonal taken,
chooses third cell if opponent has 2 cells in a row/column/diagonal
taken
4. Master
Chooses center cell first if "X",
chooses third cell if 2 cells in a row/column/diagonal taken,
chooses third cell if opponent has 2 cells in a row/column/diagonal
taken
preferably chooses diagonals over columns/rows
